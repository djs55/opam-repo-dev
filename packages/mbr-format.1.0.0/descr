Read and write Master Boot Records

This pure OCaml library allows the Master Boot Records to be read
and written. The intended purpose is to programmatically create
disk images containing old-style partition tables, which then
contain filesystems which then contain
[mirage](http://www.openmirage.org/) kernels.
